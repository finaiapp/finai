## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Plaid and AI are independent tracks converging at Phase 7 (AI needs unified transaction data from Phase 4)
- [Roadmap]: Separate plaid_transactions table from manual transactions, unified query layer on top
- [Roadmap]: ACH transfers / bill pay deferred to v2 (compliance burden)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Plaid "Development" environment deprecated June 2024 — verify existing keys are Limited Production before Phase 1
- [Research]: AI SDK v6 introduced breaking changes — verify exact API surface during Phase 7 planning
- [Research]: Webhook JWT verification library choice needed during Phase 3 planning (jose vs jsonwebtoken)
